1. Server-Side PKI Frameworks & Cryptographic Libraries
1.1 Bouncy Castle (Java)
Purpose:
Bouncy Castle is a comprehensive cryptographic library for Java that provides a wide array of cryptographic APIs.

Role in the Project:

Key and Certificate Generation: Used for generating keys and certificates as part of a self-managed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

Certificate Management: Helps in creating and signing certificates (including Root and Intermediate CAs) directly within the Java backend.

Low-Level Cryptographic Operations: Provides robust cryptographic functions that support encryption, decryption, and other security operations essential for the system.

1.2 Java KeyStore (JKS)
Purpose:
Java KeyStore is a secure repository used to store and manage cryptographic keys and certificates.

Role in the Project:

Secure Storage: Stores the keys and certificates generated by the PKI system.

Access Control: Manages and restricts access to cryptographic material.

Certificate Validation: Facilitates the verification of certificates during secure messaging sessions.

1.3 OpenSSL (CLI Integration)
Purpose:
OpenSSL is a command-line toolkit for cryptographic operations, including key and certificate generation.

Role in the Project:

Supplementary Tool: Although the backend is entirely in Java, OpenSSL can be used externally to generate or verify certificates.

Testing and Verification: Helps in verifying certificate policies and generating test certificates, which can be imported into the Java KeyStore for further operations.

2. Secure Messaging & Cryptographic Frameworks
2.1 Libsignal-Protocol-Java
Purpose:
Libsignal-Protocol-Java implements the Signal Protocol, which includes key components such as the X3DH key agreement and the Double Ratchet algorithm.

Role in the Project:

End-to-End Encryption: Manages session setup, key exchanges, and continuous key updates to ensure secure messaging between users.

Customizable Security: Allows customization of parameters like key update frequency and key derivation functions to tailor the security-performance trade-offs for experimentation.

2.2 Bouncy Castle (Supplementary)
Purpose:
In addition to its primary role in the PKI module, Bouncy Castle is also used as a supplementary cryptographic library.

Role in the Project:

Additional Cryptographic Primitives: Provides functions such as hashing, AEAD encryption, and other low-level cryptographic operations that may not be directly covered by Libsignal-Protocol-Java.

Enhanced Security: Acts as a fallback or enhancement layer to ensure robust security during encryption and decryption processes.
