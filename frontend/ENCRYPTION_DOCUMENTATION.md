# Double Ratchet Encryption Implementation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the double ratchet encryption system implemented in this Svelte 5 application.

## Overview

The Double Ratchet algorithm is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and post-compromise security. It's the same protocol used by Signal, WhatsApp, and other secure messaging applications.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CryptoUtils** (`src/lib/encryption/crypto-utils.ts`)
   - Low-level cryptographic operations
   - Key generation and derivation
   - Encryption/decryption primitives

2. **SecureKeyStorage** (`src/lib/encryption/key-storage.ts`)
   - Secure storage of encryption keys using IndexedDB
   - Master password-based encryption
   - Key lifecycle management

3. **DoubleRatchetProtocol** (`src/lib/encryption/double-ratchet.ts`)
   - Core double ratchet implementation
   - Message encryption/decryption
   - Key rotation and session management

4. **EncryptionService** (`src/lib/encryption/encryption-service.ts`)
   - High-level API with Svelte stores
   - Reactive state management
   - Message history and conversation management

## Security Features

### Forward Secrecy
- Each message is encrypted with a unique key
- Keys are immediately deleted after use
- Past messages remain secure even if current keys are compromised

### Post-Compromise Security
- Automatic key rotation restores security after compromise
- Future messages become secure again through the ratcheting process

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Identity Keys**: Ed25519 for digital signatures
- **Ephemeral Keys**: X25519 for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF with SHA-256
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure random bytes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { encryptionService } from '$lib/encryption/encryption-service.js';

// Initialize encryption with password and device ID
await encryptionService.initialize('your-secure-password', 12345);
```

### Sending Messages

```typescript
// Send an encrypted message
const encryptedMessage = await encryptionService.sendMessage(
  'recipient-id',
  'Hello, this is a secure message!',
  'sender-id'
);
```

### Receiving Messages

```typescript
// Decrypt a received message
const decryptedMessage = await encryptionService.receiveMessage(encryptedMessage);
console.log(decryptedMessage.plaintext);
```

## Security Considerations

### Strengths
✅ **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on sender's device and only decrypted on recipient's device
✅ **Forward Secrecy**: Past messages remain secure even if current keys are compromised
✅ **Post-Compromise Security**: Future messages become secure again after key rotation
✅ **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides both confidentiality and authenticity
✅ **Secure Key Storage**: Keys are encrypted with master password before storage

### Limitations and Considerations
⚠️ **Demo Implementation**: This is a demonstration - production use requires additional security measures
⚠️ **Side-Channel Attacks**: No protection against timing attacks or other side-channel vulnerabilities
⚠️ **Key Exchange**: Simplified key exchange - production systems need secure key distribution
⚠️ **Metadata Protection**: Message metadata (timestamps, participants) is not encrypted
⚠️ **Device Security**: Security depends on the underlying device and browser security

### Production Security Recommendations
1. **Secure Key Exchange**: Implement proper key verification and exchange protocols
2. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ensure ephemeral keys are properly deleted
3. **Secure Random Generation**: Use hardware random number generators when available
4. **Memory Protection**: Clear sensitive data from memory immediately after use
5. **Audit and Testing**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
6. **Side-Channel Protection**: Implement constant-time operations where possible

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Key Caching**: Avoid redundant key derivations
- **Efficient Binary Operations**: Use Uint8Array for all cryptographic operations
- **Web Crypto API**: Hardware-accelerated encryption when available
- **IndexedDB**: Efficient local storage with encryption

### Recommended Optimizations for Production
1. **Web Workers**: Move encryption operations to background threads
2. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple messages together
3. **Memory Management**: Clear sensitive data from memory promptly
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections

## Browser Compatibility

### Requirements
- **Web Crypto API**: For cryptographic operations
- **IndexedDB**: For secure key storage
- **Uint8Array**: For binary data handling
- **ES2020+**: For modern JavaScript features

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 57+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+
